## About
This project was worked on by a team of 5 including me for the purpose of my software engineering course. This is the code for a UCTronics car used for line tracking and obstacle avoidance. To line track, the car would use its sensors to detect a line under the car, and the code would run our code using the WIFIRobotCar app on Google Play/Apple Store to avoid obstacles.

## Contribution
I helped brainstorm ideas and implement the script for obstacle avoidance. I also wrote documentation for the project which can be found here: 

## Thoughts
The idea of the project was fascinating to me, albeit I didn't really know how to code in Arduino. However, I got used to it within a few days. It was also great to see the physical effects that a line of code can have on a physical object. The effiency of the code could definitely be improved on if we had more time. Another thing that could have been improved on is accounting for the different scenarios in which the car can avoid an obstacle (Going around left vs Going around right).
